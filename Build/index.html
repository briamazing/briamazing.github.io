    <h1>Home Is Where The Content Is</h1>

    <p>Welcome stranger! I should start by telling you what you&#8217;re looking at, as I’m sure it isn’t making a lot of sense. First, I’ll give you some context.</p>

    <p>I have somehow gone <strong>years</strong> without a portfolio which is not something I recommend to any junior designers reading on. In terms of networking and introductions, I’ve pretty much coasted on a lot of good timing, luck, and dribbble (thank god for <a href="http://dribbble.com/taurean" target="_blank" alt="Taurean Bryant on Dribbble">dribbble</a>). But it’s time to grow up. Had I followed through on the 100+ portfolio concepts I’ve had over the last 5 years and allowed that portfolio to mature over time, who knows where I would have wound up. </p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve also been simultaneously embarrassed my ability to write and envious of those that actually can. Writing has always been something I’ve enjoyed in the past, but I have never been consistent. Usually I get overwhelmed with the quality of my writing and then give up. There is really only one master rule to becoming great at something: do it over and over until you can say “I don’t <em>completely</em> hate this” without feeling like a liar. Then keep doing it.</p>

    <p>This project is a way to kill two birds with one stone. This site is going to be my new home online and as I create new things, I&#8217;ll add additional wings to this site just to house that new content. As to what falls under ’content’, I&#8217;m not sure yet. I&#8217;m going to try to fill this with new thoughts, hopefully 300&#8211;500 words or so at a time. I&#8217;ll also use this as a way to showcase the work I&#8217;m most proud of. Outside of that, I guess you&#8217;ll just have to wait and see. </p>

    <p>A lot is going to change over the next few weeks/months/years. Aesthetically, functionally, performance wise. I’m going to make a lot of mistakes, and hopefully I’m going to have some great ideas along the way. I’ll be cataloging all of that for you, along with the thoughts that go with it. The only thing that will stay the same will be the content. The only thing that I ask of you is that if you decide to follow along, feel free to hold me accountable on keeping it active. Life is not going to stop happening while I work on this and I’m not going to let that stop me but old habits die hard. In addition to just becoming a better writer and designer, I’ll also be learning how to finally follow through. </p>
